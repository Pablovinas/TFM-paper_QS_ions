# TFM-paper_QS_ions
This code is part of my end of master's degree thesis and also part of a future paper which is still in progress. 

First, I show how to compute the critical line for a $\lambda\phi^4$ self-interacting field phase transition. This is made in the critical_field script,
in which it is also computed a contourplot with T in the Y axis in order to compare with experiments.

Secondly, the same thing is made after introducting long-range interactions in order to predict the behavour of the simulation made with an ion trap. 
This is shown in the script named critical_ions. In addition, a program to compute the equilibrium possitions of the ions attending to the trap 
frequencies is provided.

All the work considers Matsubara frequencies to take into account thermal effects.
